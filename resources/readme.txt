Flame - partial Dungeon Keeper 2 recompilation with bug fixes
source code: https://github.com/DiaLight/Flame

How to install:
- copy `DKII-Flame-1.7.0-*.exe` to game directory (no need rename to DKII-DX.exe or DKII.exe. exe name does not matter)
- (optional, but recommended) copy `Data` directory with replacement to the game directory
- run `DKII-Flame-1.7.0-*.exe`

The `DKII-Flame-1.7.0-*.map` file you dont need to copy.
I need it if I suddenly need to debug an old build

The `Date` folder contains patches for some campaign maps taken from the link https://keeperklan.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=141
