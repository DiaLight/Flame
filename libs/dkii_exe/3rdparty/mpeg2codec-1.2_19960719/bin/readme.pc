This archive contains precompiled executables of mpeg2encode and
mpeg2decode (without graphics support) for MSDOS. The programs are
mpeg2enc.exe and mpeg2dec.exe. They require at least a '386, for
mpeg2enc.exe a '387 is strongly recommended.

For usage of the programs refer to the documentation in the source code
distribution which is available via anonymous ftp from:

ftp.netcom.com:/pub/cfogg/mpeg2/mpeg2codec_v1.1.tar.gz

The programs may need up to 2-3 MB of RAM to run without paging. Don't
reserve all your free memory for a RAMDISK or EMS. This could drastically
reduce performance.

If the programs complain about the CPU not being in real mode, you have
an EMS emulator installed with the option -noems. You need to remove
this option.

If the programs exit with a 'malloc failed' error message you don't
have enough RAM available. In this case make sure the environment
variable GO32TMP points to a directory on your hard disk with sufficient
room for the paging file.

If you don't have a math coprocessor, you have to enter

  set go32=emu c:\mpeg2\emu387

replacing the path with the appropriate one for your installation. This
activates an emulator for floating-point instructions. In this case the
encoder runs about 10 times slower than with a '387.

The programs in this archive are compiled with GNU gcc into 32 bit flat
memory code and therefore need a 32 bit DOS extender to run under MSDOS.
The .exe files include the DOS extender GO32 (version 1.11maint5) by
DJ Delorie. Sources and executables of the complete development system
